"""A database encapsulating collections of near-Earth objects and their close approaches.

A `NEODatabase` holds an interconnected data set of NEOs and close approaches.
It provides methods to fetch an NEO by primary designation or by name, as well
as a method to query the set of close approaches that match a collection of
user-specified criteria.

Under normal circumstances, the main module creates one NEODatabase from the
data on NEOs and close approaches extracted by `extract.load_neos` and
`extract.load_approaches`.

    """A database of near-Earth objects and their close approaches.

    A `NEODatabase` contains a collection of NEOs and a collection of close

        `.approaches` attribute of each `NearEarthObject` resolves to an empty
        collection, and the `.neo` attribute of each `CloseApproach` is None.

        However, each `CloseApproach` has an attribute (`._designation`) that
        matches the `.designation` attribute of the corresponding NEO. This
        constructor modifies the supplied NEOs and close approaches to link them
        together - after it's done, the `.approaches` attribute of each NEO has
        a collection of that NEO's close approaches, and the `.neo` attribute of
        each close approach references the appropriate NEO.
