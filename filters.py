"""Provide filters for querying close approaches and limit the generated
results.

The `create_filters` function produces a collection of objects that is
used by the `query` method to generate a stream of `CloseApproach`
objects that match all of the desired criteria. The arguments to
`create_filters` are provided by the main module and originate from the
user's command-line options.

This function can be thought to return a collection of instances of
subclasses of `AttributeFilter` - a 1-argument callable (on a
`CloseApproach`) constructed from a comparator (from the `operator`
module), a reference value, and a class method `get` that subclasses
can override to fetch an attribute of interest from the supplied
`CloseApproach`.

The `limit` function simply limits the maximum number of values
produced by an iterator.

You'll edit this file in Tasks 3a and 3c.
